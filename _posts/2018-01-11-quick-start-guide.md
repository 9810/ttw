My specific trip was kind of a weird blend between discovery journey and art project.. I learned a lot from the #vanlife movement etc and met a lot of plain travelers but it was never something I identified with 100%.. and actually less and less as the trip progressed. So in the end I saw the mode of travel simply as the cheapest and most flexible way of documenting the countries and topics and meeting the artists.
